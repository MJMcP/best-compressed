                    Compression garments are pieces of clothing that fit tightly around the skin. In medical contexts, 
                    compression garments provide support for people who have poor circulation. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Compression garments worn on the legs can help prevent deep vein thrombosis and reduce swelling, especially while traveling. Compression can also be used for post surgeries, 
                    to help with the healing process. Garment usage varies per patient but can be worn up to a year. 
                </p>
                <br>   
                <p>
                    Support stockings that can be bought without prescription over the counter help for people who suffer 
                    with heavy legs after a long day standing.                
                </p>
                <br>            
                <p>
                   There is also second stage compression garments, that are every day wear. Form-fitting compression sportswear, 
                   usually made of spandex, is commonly worn by athletes to prevent chafing and rashes during exercise and also 
                   to aid in recovery. Calf sleeves are worn during periods of prolonged exercise e.g. marathon running but not adviced for travel.

                                 The classes of compression are prescribed based on the user's measurements as well as needs.
                                 The higher the compression class, the greater the pressure exerted. Always insure that you are 
                                 properly measured to ensure best benefit.
                            </p>

                            <p>While some manufacturers have their own scales, the standardised classes are as follows: 
                            <ul>
                                <li><em>Over the Counter : 15-20 mmHg</em> - mild swelling and fatigued legs due to long periods of travel, sitting or standing.</li>
                                <li><em>Class I : 20-30 mmHg</em> - great for managing swelling in your legs, spider veins, varicose veins, travel, sports and after certain surgeries. Also in pregnancies. </li>
                                <li><em>Class II : 30-40 mmHg</em> - recommended for leg health symptoms that range from moderate to severe, notably DVT or some lymphoedema sufferers. </li>
                                <li><em>Class III : over 40 mmHg</em> - This level of compression is used for severe venous stasis, wound management, and lymphedema.</li>
