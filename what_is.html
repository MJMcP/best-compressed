            Compression garments are pieces of clothing that fit tightly around the skin. In medical contexts, 
            compression garments provide support for people who have to stand for long periods or have poor 
            circulation.

            These come in varying degrees of compression, and higher degree compression sleeves, 
            such as sleeves that provide compression of 20â€“30 mmHg or higher, typically require a doctor's 
            prescription.

            Compression garments worn on the legs can help prevent deep vein thrombosis and reduce swelling, especially while traveling. Compression can also be used for post surgeries, 
            to help with the healing process. Garment usage varies per patient but can be worn up to a year.

            There is also second stage compression garments, that are every day wear. 
            In sports, form-fitting compression sportswear, usually made of spandex, is commonly worn by athletes and in exercise 
            to prevent chafing and rashes.
