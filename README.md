# <em>Best Compressed</em>

The Best Compressed website is a public information website that provides advice and user-led suggestions for those who use compression garments. Its aim is to present the information about the various types of compression garments available and to clear up some of the confusion about the purpose of one type over another.

The live site can be accessed through this [link](https://www.github.io/best-compressed/index.html).

## Wireframes

The wireframes for this site were produced and are hosted on the site [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.cloud/sggsq12/pfyavp4/rCDA5?f=N4IgUiBcCMA0IDkpxAYWfAMhkAhHAsjgFo4DSUA2gLoC%2BQA%3D). Please click link to view them and the planning notes.

## Site Structure

 The style of this site will be simple and uncomplicated due in consideration of the large age scope and possible divides in user prowess with internet technology. Any possible and futher design works will take the computer user generational divide into consideration. 
 
 It consists of 3 formatted pages consisting of a hero image, a main description section and 3 subsequent column sections and 2 additional pages, one with a form box for the collection of data in the aim of creating the database of personal advice from experience compression wearers and another with a thank you message to acknowledge the sent data.

## Design Choices

### Typography
The fonts chosen for this project were 'Kavoon' for the headings (h1, h2 etc) and 'ABeeZee' for the body text.
  - Kavoon is considered a Comic/Cartoon style which has a heavy font weight as normal and that appears to be somewhat condensed in the manner of the letter forms. It was chosen to play on the topic of the site until a more formal logo can be designed.
  - ABeeZee is, according to its design Anja Meiners, "a children's learning font. Open, friendly and simple, the definite shapes support the process of learning to read and write." It maintains a clean distinction in letter form as the screen sizes adjust.

# FEATURES
## Existing Features
<!-- do yo u want to reference the specific project files that implement them? -->
## Home 

### Navigation Bar
  - Situated at the top of the page, the page logo 'BEST COMPRESSED' is shown on the left hand side with the page menu located on the right, listing this HOME page as well as 3 addional pages. Each page is assigned an icon as a visual aid. 
  - Once the site adapts for smaller screen sizes, the page logo will relocate to the center of screen with the menu options underneath it. Due to the length of some of the link names, the icons will be used instead of text when the site adapts. 

[Back to Contents](#contents)

### Introduction
  -   This is a general introduction to the ethos of the site and its aims going forward.
  There is also a content disclaimer which reminds the user that the information here is a general guide and that the best advice comes from those trained and who have full knowledge of their individual situation. A repetition of this will appear in the footer of each page.
  - The 3 columns below the general information section will provide a image link and brief description to the additional pages purpose.

[Back to Contents](#contents)

### Footer
   - Fixed at the bottom of the screen, the footer contains the constant Disclaimer relating to the content of the site  on the left hand side.
   - There are also 3 links to relatable social media for the site's content. These three platforms were chosen for their generally understood UI which will aid the cross generational divide. 
   - There is a 'Date Updated' information line to reflect the current nature of the information provided.

### What is a Compression Garment page
  - Inheriting the layout of the Landing Page, the information presented here explains simply the purposes of a Compression Garment. 
  - The 3 column section uses images to catagorise the 3 main types and provides bulletpoints of the main differences of each type.     
  - The disclaimer for the intent of the site can be seen in the footer along with the social media icons.

[Back to Contents](#contents)

### Wear and Care page
  - Inheriting the layout of the Landing Page, the information presented here is predominantly video based instruction videos for the main areas of consideration : the washing and upkeep of the garments themselves and the protection of the skin layer where appropriate. Each video will load with controls and muted for optimal user experience.
  - The disclaimer for the intent of the site can be seen in the footer along with the social media icons.

[Back to Contents](#contents)

### Tried and Tested page
  - The current format of this page similar in header and footer layout of its siblings.
  - The main content on this page consists of a form box with name, email address and text box fields for contributing to the advice element of the site.
  - The disclaimer for the intent of the site can be seen in the footer along with the social media icons.

## Features Left to Implement
 
This site was initially conceived as a public information resource with an option for adaptation depending on user feedback. Some of the features that are intended for the future without feedback are as follows
 
- Official Logo for use on site and as a watermark for other associated media
- Advice board where collected tips will be displayed
- Animation/Pop-up of disclaimer, negating the need for its placement in the text of the information section. 
- Self produced media content: videos and photos to replace the externally sourced content 
- possible link page to reputable sellers of accessories once self produced content is in place as current image licencing agreement makes this a conflict.

- CSS to provide the styling.
- Github to host and edit the website.
- Gitpod to deploy the website.

## Testing

<!-- go over all the projects features, what they were supposed to do and how they have worked.
how does the project look in the different browsers and screen sizes
mention any issues you have had - interesting bugs -->
In the building of the site, the major issues I had to deal with involved the following :

- Weak Design Elements
  - When I first designed the layout, I wanted to keep it clean and simplistic so that it didn't overwhelm the sensibilities of any of the users. However, the combination of 'Dela Gothic One' and 'Lora' proved to be less impactful that I thought. At the beginning of the testing phase, I was advised to rethink this approach and so the fonts "Kavoon" and "ABeeZee" were chosen to replace the original choices. 

[Back to Contents](#contents)

- Column layout and image sizing to format

- Menu layout and presentation on smaller viewports
  - Due to the length of the text links, I added icons to the links that would become the navigation icons when the site is viewed on a smaller screen.  This was done by adding classes to target the text and icons seperately so they could be hidden or seen as needed.

- 'Return to Homepage' button
  - The main issue that I encountered with this button was the fact that I expected it to react as the Submit button did on the Tried and Tested page. After many attempts to rectify the possible link issue, I realised that I needed to treat the button layout like an imported image or icon. I used the button element and its attributes as an additional attribute of the a element that actively opens the homepage.

- Video Embedding   
  - When I first attempted to insert a link for the youtube videos that I had selected, I was immediately shown an error message for where the video should appear. My first source of assistance was the Slack channels of CI where I searched for "embed youtube link into html". One member suggested the video embed generator created by Codegena but warned of issues may occur in validation later. I decided to use the generator for the moment as they work for MVP and I hope to correct before official launch of site on June 23rd 2022.
