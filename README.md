# <em>Best Compressed</em>

The Best Compressed website is a public information website that provides advice and user-led suggestions for those who use compression garments. Its aim is to present the information about the various types of compression garments available and to clear up some of the confusion about the purpose of one type over another.

The live site can be accessed through this [link](https://www.github.io/best-compressed/index.html).

## Wireframes

The wireframes for this site were produced and are hosted on the site [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.cloud/sggsq12/pfyavp4/rCDA5?f=N4IgUiBcCMA0IDkpxAYWfAMhkAhHAsjgFo4DSUA2gLoC%2BQA%3D). Please click link to view them and the planning notes.

## Site Structure

 The style of this site will be simple and uncomplicated due in consideration of the large age scope and possible divides in user prowess with internet technology. Any possible and futher design works will take the computer user generational divide into consideration. 
 
 It consists of 3 formatted pages consisting of a hero image, a main description section and 3 subsequent column sections and an additional 4th page with a form box for the collection of data in the aim of creating the database of personal advice from experience compression wearers. It is initially conceived as a public information resource with an option for adaptation depending on user feedback.

Animation of disclaimer if not possible here
Self produced content 
interview pages with individuals who use and wear garments
possible link page to reputable sellers of accessories once self produced content is in place-->

## Testing

<!-- go over all the projects features, what they were supposed to do and how they have worked.
how does the project look in the different browsers and screen sizes
mention any issues you have had - interesting bugs -->
In the building of the site, the major issues I had to deal with involved the following :

- Weak Design Elements
  - When I first designed the layout, I wanted to keep it clean and simplistic so that it didn't overwhelm the sensibilities of any of the users. However, the combination of 'Dela Gothic One' and 'Lora' proved to be less impactful that I thought. 
  At the beginning of the testing phase, I was advised to rethink this approach and so the fonts "" and "" were chosen to replace the original choices. 
  - Column layout and image sizing to format

- Video Embedding   
  - When I first attempted to insert a link for the youtube videos that I had selected, I was immediately shown an error message for where the video should appear. My first source of assistance was the Slack channels of CI where I searched for "embed youtube link into html". One member suggested the video embed generator created by Codegena but warned of issues may occur in validation later. I decided to use the generator for the moment as they work for MVP and I hope to correct before official launch of site on June 23rd 2022. 

### Validator Testing
<!-- the reports back from these validators -->
HTML with W3C validator
CSS with (Jigsaw) validator
Accessibility (lighthouse in dev tools)
### Unfixed Bugs

## Deployment
<!-- the description of how it was deployed to the hosting platform-->
The site was deployed to Github pages using these steps:
  1.  Open the relevent repository in my Github account.
  2.  Navigate to the Github Pages tab via 'Settings'.
  3.  Select 'Main' from the drop down menu in the Source section.
  4.  Click 'Save' once you have confirmed that the branch is listed as Main and that the folder selected is the root folder.
